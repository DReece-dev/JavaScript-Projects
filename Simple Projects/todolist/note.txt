This code is for a simple task manager. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

Initialization: The code first gets references to the form, input field, and task list from the HTML document. It also initializes an empty tasks array to store all the tasks.

Adding a Task: The addTask function is triggered when the form is submitted. It prevents the page from refreshing (which is the default behavior), gets the task text from the input field, and adds it to the tasks array if it's not empty. It then calls renderTasks to display the tasks and clears the input field.

Toggling Task Completion: The toggleTaskCompletion function is triggered when a task is clicked. It finds the task in the tasks array and toggles its completion status, then calls renderTasks to update the display.

Rendering Tasks: The renderTasks function clears the task list and then adds each task to it. Each task is a list item with a span for the task text and buttons for editing and deleting the task. It also adds event listeners to the edit and delete buttons.

Editing a Task: The handleEditTask function is triggered when the edit button is clicked. It finds the task in the tasks array, prompts the user for a new task text, and updates the task if a new text is provided. It then calls renderTasks to update the display.

Deleting a Task: The handleDeleteTask function is triggered when the delete button is clicked. It removes the task from the tasks array and calls renderTasks to update the display.

Event Listeners: Finally, the code adds an event listener to the form to call addTask when the form is submitted, and calls renderTasks to display the initial tasks.
